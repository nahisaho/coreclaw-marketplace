# Scientific Peer Review

experimentresults systematic evaluation、reproducibilitymethod's
allabout is providedskill。

## When to Use

- experimentresults's is evaluatedand
- paper's cell is performedand
- 's experimentresultswhen needed
- analysis's is verifiedand

## Quick Start

### Step 1: datareport's
- experimentdatafile's verification（CSV, JSON, ）
- experimentreport / conversation.md 's
- formethodparameters's

### Step 2: method'sevaluation
- experiment's（group's 、）
- sample size's min
- measurementmethod's
- 's possible

### Step 3: analysis'sverification
- formethod's
- multiple comparisoncorrection's
- effect size's
- confidence interval's
- p-value's 's

### Step 4: reproducibility's evaluation
- procedure's detailsdegree（possible）
- data's
- environmentcondition's

### Step 5: reportgeneration

## Output Format

`peer_review.md` below/following's structuregeneration:

```markdown
# peer reviewreport

## evaluation
[A: / B: / C: fix / D: fix]

## 1. method'sevaluation
## 2. analysis's
## 3. reproducibility's evaluation
## 4. data's
## 5. conclusion's
## 6. improvement
## 7. recommendedterm
```

## Scoring Criteria

| item | evaluationcriteria |
|------|---------|
| method | experiment's 、group、 |
| | method's 、multiple comparison、effect size |
| reproducibility | procedure's detailsdegree、data |
| conclusion | dataconclusion |

## Examples

**Prompt Examples:**
- 「's experimentresults」
- 「analysis'speer review」
- 「reproducibility's pointfromevaluation」

## Data Acquisition

> All data retrieval is implemented in Python using `requests` and public REST APIs.
> No external ToolUniverse tools are required.

### Implementation Pattern

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

def fetch_api_data(url, params=None):
    """Generic REST API data retrieval with error handling."""
    resp = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=30)
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.json()
```

### Report Generation

After data acquisition, generate a structured report:

1. Save raw results to `results/` as CSV/JSON
2. Create visualizations in `figures/`
3. Write `report.md` in the same language as the user's input, summarizing methods, results, and interpretation

## Harness Optimization (v0.5.0)

> Optimized following [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)
> harness performance patterns: eval-first, multi-phase verification, model routing,
> sub-agent orchestration, and systematic error recovery.

### Eval Criteria (Writing/Review)

Before execution, define:
- [ ] **Target venue**: journal name, word/page limit, citation style
- [ ] **Document structure**: required sections (IMRaD / custom)
- [ ] **Quality standard**: PRISMA / CONSORT / ARRIVE as applicable
- [ ] **Completeness check**: all required sections present

#### Pass Criteria
- All citations verifiable (DOI or PMID present)
- No placeholder text remaining ([TODO], [CITE], etc.)
- Figure/table references match actual figures/tables
- Word count within target range
### Verification Loop

```
Phase 1: PLAN
  |-- Define eval criteria (above checklist)
  |-- Confirm input data availability and format
  |-- Select analysis methods with justification
  +-- Estimate resource requirements (time, memory, API calls)

Phase 2: EXECUTE
  |-- Run analysis pipeline step-by-step
  |-- Save intermediate results after each major step
  |-- Log execution time per step
  +-- Capture warnings/errors without stopping

Phase 3: VERIFY
  |-- Check all Pass Criteria (above)
  |-- Validate output file existence and non-empty
  |-- Cross-check numeric results for sanity (ranges, signs, units)
  |-- Verify figures are readable and correctly labeled
  +-- Run regression check: did existing outputs break?

Phase 4: RECOVER (on failure)
  |-- Identify failed phase and root cause
  |-- Isolate minimum reproducer
  |-- Apply fix and re-run only failed phase
  |-- Log fix as reusable pattern
  +-- If unrecoverable: document limitation and partial results

Phase 5: REPORT
  |-- Generate report.md with all sections in the user's input language
  |-- Embed all figures with captions
  |-- Save numeric results as JSON/CSV
  |-- List all generated files
  +-- Record execution metadata (duration, versions, seed)
```

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Check | Required |
|------|-------|----------|
| G1 | All figures saved to `figures/` (not `plt.show()`) | MUST |
| G2 | All figures embedded in `report.md` | MUST |
| G3 | Numeric results saved as JSON/CSV in `results/` | MUST |
| G4 | Report includes methods, results, discussion | MUST |
| G5 | All figure/table text is English-only; report.md body matches the user's input language | MUST |
| G6 | No hardcoded paths (use `Path` / config) | MUST |
| G7 | Random seed set and documented | MUST |
| G8 | Execution time logged | RECOMMENDED |
| G9 | Input validation performed | RECOMMENDED |
| G10 | Error messages are actionable | RECOMMENDED |

### Model Routing

| Task Complexity | Model Tier | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Mechanical | `fast` (haiku-class) | Data formatting, file I/O, unit conversion |
| Implementation | `standard` (sonnet-class) | Analysis code, pipeline execution, plotting |
| Reasoning | `premium` (opus-class) | Hypothesis generation, result interpretation, review |

### Sub-Agent Orchestration

When the task is complex, split into parallel sub-agents:

```
Orchestrator (this skill)
|-- Agent 1: Data preparation and validation
|-- Agent 2: Core analysis / computation
|-- Agent 3: Visualization and figure generation
+-- Agent 4: Report writing and quality check
```

Each sub-agent receives:
- Specific scope (what to do)
- Input specification (what data to use)
- Output specification (what files to produce)
- Quality gate subset (which gates to check)

### Token Optimization

- Load only the sub-skill needed for the current task
- Compact context after each major phase (discard intermediate logs)
- Use structured output (JSON) over prose for intermediate results
- Prefer code templates over natural language descriptions
- Cache expensive computations (API calls, model training)

### Error Recovery Protocol

```python
def execute_with_recovery(pipeline_steps, max_retries=2):
    results = {}
    for step in pipeline_steps:
        for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
            try:
                results[step.name] = step.execute()
                break
            except Exception as e:
                if attempt < max_retries:
                    log(f"Step '{step.name}' failed (attempt {attempt+1}): {e}")
                    step.adjust_params()  # reduce batch size, increase timeout
                else:
                    log(f"Step '{step.name}' unrecoverable: {e}")
                    results[step.name] = {"status": "failed", "error": str(e)}
    return results
```
